# User Management System (Login, Logout, Profile)

This project provides basic user management functionalities like login, logout, and profile management, built with PHP for backend and HTML/CSS for frontend. The system allows users to log in, view and edit their profile, and securely log out.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can authenticate using their credentials.
- **Logout**: Users can securely log out of the system.
- **Profile**: After logging in, users can view and edit their profile information.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Backend for handling user authentication, session management, and database interactions.
- **HTML**: Markup for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the web pages.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- PHP (version 7.4 or higher)
- MySQL
- A local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/), or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manikantay11/Login-Form/user-management-system.git
   cd user-management-system
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a MySQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE user_management;
     ```
   - Import the SQL schema provided in the `database.sql` file (if provided).

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Open `config.php` and update the database connection settings (host, username, password).

4. **Start the server**:
   - If you're using XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, start Apache and MySQL services.
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost/user-management-system/
     ```

## File Structure

```
/user-management-system

│
├── /public          # Public-facing pages
│   ├── login.php    # Login page
│   ├── logout.php   # Logout page
│   └── profile.php  # Profile page


```

## How to Use

### 1. Log in as an existing user
- Go to `login.php`.
- Enter your username/email and password.
- After successful login, you will be redirected to your profile page.

### 2. View/Edit Profile
- After logging in, go to `profile.php`.
- You can view and edit your profile information (e.g., username, email).
- Changes will be saved to the database when you submit the form.

### 3. Log out
- To log out, visit `logout.php`.
- You will be logged out and redirected to the login page.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using PHP’s `password_hash()` function before being stored in the database.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are used to manage user login states. Proper session handling is done to prevent session hijacking.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.
